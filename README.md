# Tweets about suicide: stories of bereaved individuals

Owner: Anja Huber; IntoResearch 2 Project of MeiCogSci Master

Supervision: Hannah Metzler

Topic: labelling 200 tweets for the categories of bereaved stories about suffering or coping, and training a tf-idf & SVM classifier

Outcome: a third category of rather neutral tweets must be considered when talking about bereaved postings. It is questionable if the subcategories of bereaved tweets are important for the use case, or if it is sufficient to detect bereaved tweets inside the group of suicide related postings. The suggeted model for this use case performed well.
